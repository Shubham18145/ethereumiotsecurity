Ethereum Distributed Application for securing Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor data

Dataset - Using smartphones' embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
